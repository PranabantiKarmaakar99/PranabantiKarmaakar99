🚀 Projects

SuperTramApp: This is an app which helps you track trams within Sheffield and book it for different durations and age-groups . Also, there is an updating facility through community chats. This has an interactive UI using openstreet maps which dislays the different tram routes and also shows all the tram stops.  This has ASP .NET framework as backend and React as frontend . This one is a mobile-responsive app. 

PayTM: This app helps you transfer money to the existing users within the Paytm app. You can see all your transactions and also search existing users in the app. The backend is express node.js and frontend is ReactJS.

The Abode:  This is my ongoing work for dissertation-so this one WIP. This is built in NextJS , will be utilising Next Auth. In this webapp I am also experimenting with GSAP, which helps in enhanced UI/UX inducing animation. The aim is to build a interior design-built estimation app which can help homeowners buy customised services in a package specifically for home interior purposes in Kolkata India.
